The process starts when ContinuumCI detects an issue or pull request comment. It creates a build-type runner containing Goose and a cached clone of the branch's code, along with a limited set of tools different from our regular environment. Within this container, Goose executes its agent loop locally until it reaches a satisfactory outcome. It then pushes its changes to the PR branch before the container terminates. The PR then undergoes normal CI validation. If all checks pass, the process completes. If problems are detected, ContinuumCI identifies that Goose was involved and launches another build container to examine the issues and implement additional fixes.
