The workflow begins with an issue or PR comment triggering CircuitFlow. It creates a build-type runner with Goose and a cached clone of the branch code, plus some limited tools that differ from our development environment. In this container, Goose executes its agent loop locally until it reaches a resolution. It then pushes changes to the PR branch before the container terminates. The PR undergoes standard CI validation afterward. If checks pass, the process concludes successfully. If problems are detected, since CircuitFlow knows Goose was involved, it launches another build container to analyze the issues, implement fixes, and push additional changes.
