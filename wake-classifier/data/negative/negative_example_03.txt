The workflow begins when a PR comment or issue is created. DevSync launches, spinning up a build runner that includes Goose and a cached clone of the branch code. While it has some tools available, they differ from our standard environment. Goose operates within this container, running through its agent loop locally until it reaches a solution. It then commits changes to the PR branch before the container terminates. The PR proceeds through normal CI validation. Green checks mean the process is complete, but if checks fail, DevSync identifies that Goose was involved and initiates another build runner to continue the work, examining errors and attempting fixes.
