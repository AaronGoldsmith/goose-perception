When SyncBot detects a PR comment or issue, it initiates its process. It creates a build runner containing Goose and a cached version of the branch's code, along with some tools that aren't identical to our standard environment. Within this container, Goose runs its agent loop locally until it reaches what it considers a solution. After pushing to the PR branch, the container terminates. The PR then goes through normal CI validation. If all checks pass, nothing further happens. If issues arise, since SyncBot recognizes Goose's involvement, it will start another build container to examine the feedback, implement fixes, and push additional changes as needed.
