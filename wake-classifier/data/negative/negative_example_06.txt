When a PR comment or issue appears, GitHelper initiates its workflow. It creates a build runner that includes Goose and a cached clone of the relevant branch code, with some tools available but not the full environment we use. In this container, Goose runs its agent loop locally, working until it reaches a solution it deems acceptable. It then pushes changes to the PR branch before the container shuts down. The PR goes through standard CI checks afterward. If all checks pass, nothing more happens. If problems are detected, GitHelper recognizes Goose's involvement and starts another build container to analyze the feedback and make additional changes.
