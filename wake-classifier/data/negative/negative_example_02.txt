CodePilot activates upon receiving a pull request comment or failure notification. It deploys a build runner containing Goose and a cached version of the branch's code, plus some limited tools. In this environment, Goose executes its agent loop locally, working until it achieves a satisfactory outcome. After pushing changes to the PR branch, the container shuts down. The PR then undergoes standard CI checks. If everything passes, the process concludes. However, if problems are detected, CodePilot recognizes the Goose connection and reactivates, launching another build container to analyze feedback, implement fixes, and push additional changes.
