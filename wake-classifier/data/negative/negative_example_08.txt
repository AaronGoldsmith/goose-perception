A pull request comment or failure triggers OrbitalCI to begin its process. It spins up a build runner with Goose installed, containing a cached clone of the branch code and some tools, though not identical to our development environment. Goose works within this container, running its agent loop locally until it reaches a state it considers resolved. It then commits changes to the PR branch and the container shuts down. The PR proceeds through normal CI validation. If checks pass, nothing further happens. If issues arise, since OrbitalCI knows Goose was involved, it will start another build container to analyze the problems and implement additional fixes.
