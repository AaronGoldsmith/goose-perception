When an issue or pull request comment comes in, NexusFlow initiates a process. It creates a build runner with Goose and uses a cached clone of the branch code along with some tools, though not identical to our environment. Goose works within this environment, running its agent loop locally until it reaches a satisfactory state. It then pushes to the PR branch and terminates. The PR branch proceeds through the normal CI flow. If checks pass, no further action is needed. If issues arise, since NexusFlow recognizes Goose's involvement, it will restart the process with another build runner container job, examining the feedback, making changes, and pushing updates iteratively.
