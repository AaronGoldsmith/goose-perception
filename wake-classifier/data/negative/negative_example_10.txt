DeployBot activates when it receives a pull request comment or failure notification. It deploys a build runner containing Goose and a cached clone of the branch code, along with some tools that aren't the same as in our environment. Goose then works within this container, running its agent loop locally until it reaches a satisfactory state. It pushes changes to the PR branch before the container shuts down. The PR then undergoes standard CI validation. If all checks pass, nothing more happens. If issues are detected, DeployBot recognizes Goose's involvement and initiates another build container to analyze the feedback and implement additional changes.
