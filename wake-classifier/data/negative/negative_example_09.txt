When a PR comment or issue is detected, PipelineX begins its workflow. It creates a build runner containing Goose and a cached version of the branch code, plus some limited tools that differ from our standard environment. Goose then operates within this container, executing its agent loop locally until it reaches what it considers a solution. After pushing changes to the PR branch, the container terminates. The PR then undergoes normal CI validation. Green checks indicate success, while failures trigger PipelineX to recognize Goose's involvement and start another build container to examine the feedback, implement fixes, and push additional changes.
