AutoFlow responds when it receives a pull request comment or failure notification. It sets up a build environment containing Goose and a cached version of the branch code, along with some tools that differ from our standard environment. Goose then works within this container, executing its agent loop locally until it reaches a resolution. After pushing to the PR branch, the container terminates. The PR then goes through normal CI processing. If checks pass, the process ends successfully. If issues are found, since AutoFlow knows Goose was involved, it will initiate another build container to examine the problems and implement fixes before pushing again.
