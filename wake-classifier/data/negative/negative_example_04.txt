Upon detection of an issue or PR comment, BuildMaster triggers its process. A build-type runner with Goose is created, containing a cached clone of the branch code and a subset of tools not matching our full environment. Within this container, Goose performs its agent loop locally, working until it reaches a satisfactory state. Once complete, it pushes changes to the PR branch and the container shuts down. The PR then undergoes standard CI validation. If all checks pass, nothing further happens. If problems are detected, BuildMaster recognizes Goose's involvement and initiates another build runner to analyze the issues and implement additional changes.
