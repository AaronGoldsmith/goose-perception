  **MISSION: Setup Slack MCP integration and post team update**
  
  **STEP 1: CHECK MCP CONFIGURATION**
  Determine if Slack MCP server is already configured:
  - Check Goose configuration for existing MCP servers
  - Look for Slack-related MCP integrations
  - Check if Slack tools are already available
  
  **STEP 2: CONFIGURE MCP SERVER**
  If Slack MCP server needs setup:
  - Identify appropriate Slack MCP server (community or custom)
  - Add MCP server configuration to Goose config
  - Configure Slack API credentials/tokens as needed
  - Restart or reload Goose to pick up new MCP server
  
  **STEP 3: VERIFY MCP INTEGRATION**
  Confirm Slack MCP tools are available:
  - List available tools to verify Slack integration
  - Test basic Slack connectivity if possible
  
  **STEP 4: COMPOSE AND POST UPDATE**
  Based on recent work activity in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/, create and post a team update.
  
  **Format for Slack:**
  ```
  üöÄ **Team Update - $(date +"%B %d")**
  
  ‚úÖ **Shipped This Week:**
  ‚Ä¢ [Major accomplishments from CONTRIBUTIONS.md]
  ‚Ä¢ [Key features delivered]
  
  üîÑ **Currently Working On:**
  ‚Ä¢ [Active projects from LATEST_WORK.md]

  ‚Ä¢ [Scheduled deliverables]
  
  ‚ùì **Need Help With:**
  ‚Ä¢ [Blockers or questions]

  ```
  
  **STEP 5: POST TO SLACK**
  Post the update to:
  - Primary team channel (#engineering, #dev-team, etc.)
  - Or suggest appropriate channel based on content
  
  **FALLBACK PLAN:**
  If Slack MCP server can't be configured or doesn't work:
  1. Save formatted update to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/READY_TO_POST_SLACK.md
  2. Provide copy-paste instructions
  3. Suggest manual posting steps
  4. Include channel recommendations
  5. Provide guidance on MCP server setup for future use
  
  **OUTPUT:**
  Confirm successful posting or provide manual steps with formatted content ready to use.
  Document any MCP configuration changes made.
