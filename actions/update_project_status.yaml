  **MISSION: Configure Slack MCP integration and post a project status update**

  **STEP 1: ASSESS CURRENT MCP CONFIGURATION**
  Check if Slack MCP server is already configured by looking for existing configurations and checking for Slack-related tools.

  **STEP 2: CONFIGURE SLACK MCP SERVER (IF NEEDED)**
  If the server is not configured, identify the correct implementation, add it to settings with the necessary credentials (bot token, app token), and update the main configuration.

  **STEP 3: VERIFY MCP INTEGRATION**
  Test the setup by reloading the configuration and verifying that Slack tools are available and that basic connectivity works.

  **STEP 4: PREPARE STATUS UPDATE**
  You have been given the following project status update to post:
  ```
  {{ status_update }}
  ```

  **STEP 5: POST USING MCP TOOLS**
  You have been given user preferences as a JSON string: `{{ user_prefs }}`.
  First, determine the channel to post to.
  1. Check if the `channel` parameter `{{ channel }}` is provided. If yes, use it.
  2. If the `channel` parameter is empty, parse the `user_prefs` JSON to find the `team_channel` and use that.
  3. **If both the parameter and the preference are missing, you MUST STOP. Do not post the message. Report that you cannot proceed without a channel.**
  
  Once you have a channel, post the status update. After posting, confirm success and save any relevant reference ID.

  **FALLBACK APPROACH:**
  If MCP server setup or posting fails, document the issue, save the status update locally, and provide manual instructions for the user.

  **OUTPUT:**
  Document the outcome of the setup and posting steps, saving configuration details and providing troubleshooting guidance if anything failed.
