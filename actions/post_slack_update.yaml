  **STEP 1: CHECK SLACK MCP INTEGRATION**
  First, check if Slack MCP server is configured and available:
  - Check current MCP server configuration
  - Verify Slack MCP tools are available
  - If not configured, suggest MCP server setup (like composing message to copy/paste)
  
  **STEP 2: COMPOSE TEAM UPDATE**
  Based on recent work activity in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/, compose a team status update suitable for Slack.
  
  Analyze these files:
  - LATEST_WORK.md (current focus)
  - WORK.md (recent accomplishments)  
  - CONTRIBUTIONS.md (completed items)
  - ACTIVITY-LOG.md (recent activity)
  
  **SLACK UPDATE FORMAT:**
  Create concise, emoji-friendly update suitable for team channels:
  
  ðŸ“… **Weekly Update - [Date]**
  
  âœ… **Completed:**
  - [Key accomplishments]
  - [Features delivered]
  
  ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
  - [Current work]
  - [Next deliverables]
  
  ðŸ“‹ **Next Up:**
  - [Upcoming priorities]
  - [Dependencies/blockers]
  
  **STEP 3: POST OR PREPARE**
  If Slack MCP server is configured:
  - Use Slack MCP tools to post the update to appropriate channel (#engineering, #team-updates, etc.)
  - Confirm successful posting
  
  If Slack MCP server not available:
  - Save formatted message to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/SLACK_UPDATE_DRAFT.md
  - Provide instructions for manual posting
  - Include suggested channels and timing
  - Provide guidance on configuring Slack MCP server for future use
  
  **OUTPUT:**
  Document the action taken and provide next steps if manual posting is needed.
