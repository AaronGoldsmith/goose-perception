  Following is a transcription of a request from the user which is directed to you, goose, that you are to assist with in an autonimous manner as much as possible.
  Use tools you have available to you.

  Some additional resources for context to consider (may not be needed): 
    - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/LATEST_WORK.md contains a summary of what the user has been up to recently made by overseeing their work
    - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/INTERACTIONS.md contains a summary of who the user has been interacting with recently
    - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/CONTRIBUTIONS.md contains a summary of the users CONTRIBUTIONS.md
    - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md is a larger document with observations of work over time you may need to consult but is large   

  the transcription is in /tmp/current_transcription.txt
