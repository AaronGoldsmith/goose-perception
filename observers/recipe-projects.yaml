  look in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ for LATEST_WORK.md, INTERACTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md and use glean to clarify what project names or initivives are being worked on. 
  You can update WORK.md with clarifications for this in the last paragraph if needed. You should also consult and update the PROJECTS.md file with any new projects or initiatives that are being worked on.
  update PROJECTS.md with any new projects or initiatives that are being worked on you can see.
