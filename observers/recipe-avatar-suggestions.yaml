# INSTRUCTION: Do NOT generate suggestions that reference the current time, 'right now', or the last few minutes. Suggestions should be general, or reference past events (e.g., 'earlier today', 'in the last few hours', 'at 4:45 p.m. you...'). The system may show suggestions with a delay, so avoid anything that would only make sense in real-time.

  - INTERACTIONS.md (recent collaborations)
  - CONTRIBUTIONS.md (recent activity)
  - WORK.md (detailed work log)

  - Based on actual patterns in the data
  - Appropriate for brief, non-intrusive display
  - Varied in tone and purpose
  
  **SUGGESTION CATEGORIES (aim for 2-3 from each):**

  - Context switching patterns
  - Energy level observations
  - Optimal timing suggestions

  Focus on themes like:

  - "That discussion with [person] yesterday might need a follow-up ping"
  - "Your commit frequency shows you're in a great debugging rhythm"
  - "It's [time] - your historical peak productivity window!"
  - "I notice you're switching between 4+ projects - consider time blocking?"
  - "Great progress on [specific item] - just need to push it over the finish line"
  - "Your keyboard activity suggests deep thinking mode engaged üß†"
  - "That PR review from [person] deserves a thoughtful response"
  
  **OUTPUT FORMAT: Valid JSON only**
  
  Create a JSON object with a "suggestions" array containing 10-15 suggestion messages as strings.
  Each string should be the complete suggestion message ready for display.
  
  Example JSON format:
  {
    "suggestions": [
      "You've been coding for 90 minutes straight - time for a 5-minute break?",
      "That design discussion with Alice yesterday might need follow-up",
      "It's 9:15 AM - your peak focus time! Tackle that complex refactor now.",
      "I see 3 different repos active - consider focusing on one for deeper flow",
      "Your commit messages show great progress - you're in the zone! üöÄ",
      "That code review from Bob has been waiting 2 days - quick response?",
      "It's 2:30 PM - perfect time for routine tasks like docs or cleanup",
      "Your typing rhythm suggests you're problem-solving something tricky",
      "Great momentum on the user auth feature - almost there!",
      "I notice you keep returning to that API design - trust your instincts"
    ]
  }
  
  Save the suggestions to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/AVATAR_SUGGESTIONS.json as valid JSON.
  **Focus on being genuinely helpful - observe real patterns and suggest real value.**
  Only include suggestions that are genuinely based on patterns you observe in the data.
  If there's insufficient data for a category, generate fewer suggestions rather than generic ones.
  Do not include any text outside the JSON object - output ONLY valid JSON.
