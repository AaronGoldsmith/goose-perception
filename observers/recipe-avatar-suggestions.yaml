  Based on the current work context, analyze the following files in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/:
  - LATEST_WORK.md (current focus)
  - INTERACTIONS.md (recent collaborations)
  - CONTRIBUTIONS.md (recent activity)
  - WORK.md (detailed work log)
  - ACTIVITY-LOG.md (recent system activity)
  
  Generate 3-5 short, contextual suggestions or observations that would be appropriate for an AI avatar to display.
  Each suggestion should be:
  - Under 100 characters 
  - Actionable or insightful
  - Based on actual patterns in the data
  - Appropriate for interrupting briefly
  
  Focus on themes like:
  - Productivity patterns ("You've been focused on X for 2 hours, consider a break")
  - Follow-up reminders ("That meeting with Y yesterday might need follow-up")
  - Work optimization ("You've been switching between tasks frequently today")
  - Collaboration insights ("You've had several discussions about project Z")
  - Focus suggestions ("Your most productive time is approaching")
  
  Output format:
  suggestion_type: brief_message
  
  Example:
  productivity: "You've been coding for 90 minutes. Time for a 5-minute break?"
  collaboration: "That design discussion with Alice yesterday might need follow-up"
  focus: "You work best between 9-11 AM. It's 9:15 now - time to tackle hard tasks!"
  
  Save the suggestions to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/AVATAR_SUGGESTIONS.md in the format above.
  Only include suggestions that are genuinely based on patterns you observe in the data.
  If there's insufficient data, generate fewer suggestions rather than generic ones.
