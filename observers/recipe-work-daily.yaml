  Processing screenshots to track work being done, you will examine the screenshots to see what the user is working on and who they interact with.
  you are running in the background so do not expect more information than you can gather or see and don't ask for more.

  please look in /tmp/screenshots for screenshots of work activity which have veen taken every 20 seconds over the past day
  you can sample throught the day, maybe once per hour, and look for some changes in that time.
  it is important you note the timestamp of the file
  if the file is a picture of a desktop background only, and that is all you see, this is a failure and you should log it to FAILURES.md
    - you can also prompt the user that they will need to give permission to this process to be able to look at the screen, which may involve openning their settings
  your aim is to form a picture of what they are working on, and pay attention to changes and note them down
  The user is working on various projects so you are to summarize work going on as best you can, you can try to guess the project names being worked on from the context as more is revealed.
  if any screens are for chat or email pay attention to the people being communicated with and topics
  note what documents or files, directories, docs etc  they are working on 
  a document, or an editor, will typically be associated with a project or some past work you can look up. 
  note any interesting objects/visuals you see in case they are need to be searched for later
  any key phrases or terms you see can also be noted.
  Note down any people interacted with you can see
  If in a meeting, consider who they are meeting with and note that down too. 
  ~/.local/share/goose-perception/spoken.txt has a log of recently heard conversation, which may help you understand the context of the work being done, consider it, but it may be background chatter.

  IMPORTANT: never mention this goose-perception project in any of your reporting, it should not appear in work done, do not consider automation done by it as something work reporting out. 
  ALWAYS check attribution before giving the user credit for something. This needs to be cross checked with code, docs, interactions that they really did it, do not confuse email lists or slack broadcasts with activity being undertaken.
  If you see what you know as irrelevant things in LATEST_WORK.md, you can remove it


  Please also look at windows that are open titles to consider things.

  ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md is a record of work done, you should be appending to it. If it is over 2000 lines, truncate the older (earlier) lines. 

  Look at ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md last paragraph or so if there is one to get an idea of how to classify/improve, and write a fresh summary and add to that file. 

  
  Include time in summary and and also make it clear what changes are being made since last time. 
  The LATEST_WORK.md should also have a summary of what sequence of apps or screens they went between (very brief) 

  Append the updated summary to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md (don't over write) and also save (over write) just the update to LATEST_WORK.md in same dir.

  also remove the screenshots from /tmp/screneshots so that directory is empty when you are done
