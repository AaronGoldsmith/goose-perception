description: look for notes from the user for work to do and continue with 
instructions: |
  the notes app may be used to ask for goose to to do things
  responses and output can be added to that note for interaction and collaboration with the user
  Always stick to the one note (maybe apple notes or another notes app they regularly use)
  want to be careful and make notes as you start working on things, and check work isn't already under way for that task
  when you are working, add a comment on a new line to the note, and when finished, add another comment to the same note that you are responding to
  Always format text clearly, with linebreaks to make it clear what you are doing or asking
  When you see a note that mentions goose, note the context of work done so far and continue on

  use apple notes (or whatever you see the user use based on what you discover below) to see if there is any request of goose to take on a task it hasn't addressed. 
  Read and reply to the note with what you did and what you are doing.
  Don't double up - check the for existing notes or the note you are looking, that you haven't already addressed what the user has asked previously.

  Consult below to get work context:  
  
  look in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ for LATEST_WORK.md, INTERACTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTIONS.md, and PROJECTS.md, INTERESTS.md to form a picture of what is going on in the users work world and what they are working on.
  That should show what they have been working on, what docs, and even what files or projects/dirs they have checked out you can work on and contribute to as asked.
  WORK.md is also useful as a longer running work log if you need to search it.
  
  Consider LATEST_WORK.md if they are actually working on it now notify them that there is something relevant. 


  It is IMPORTANT you don't make descructive changes, so if it is code, then it should be a new branch, if a document, then can be a copy, or just comments back or change tracking.  
  You should ideally do your work if code in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/fixing/ dir, you can clone things there and work on a branch. If asked, you can open a pull request to the repository it came from.
  The user may ask to work on code that is already checked out (in which case you can work on a branch and pull request for it, not destructive)

  what to do 
   * look in notes app for something addressed to goose, it may be a new note or a comment fresh from the user on an existing note (you can read the note to check if there is anything new from the user, or if you are already working on it, then don't double up)
   * use ACTIVITY_LOG.md to record what was done and what you did (can refer back to it in future) for your own reference
   * When replying in notes app use clear responses and time stamped and with spacing and newlines between, make it clear what is you, and when you start, and when you finish.
   * leave notes in that note leave a log of what you did so you can pick it up next time.  
   * take action based on that considering note instructions
   * if it is an existing note that you have replied to before, but has new feedback from the user, act based on that 
   * reply to the note as you go, clearly marking things with spacing newlines
   * check the note for any comments back from the user or directions
   * write your results back to the user as clear section with newlines from you 
   * some tasks may require user input to continue or clarify, that is ok, you can add to that note and the user will reply in future (you don't have to wait, you can leave the questions if you have done all you can, and consider it finished for now)
