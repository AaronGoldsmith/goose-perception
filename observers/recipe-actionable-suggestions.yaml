  **GOOSE MCP (MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL) CAPABILITIES:**
  Goose integrates with MCP servers to provide external tool access:
  - MCP servers provide tools, resources, and prompts for LLM interactions
  - Common MCP servers available: Slack, GitHub, file systems, databases, APIs, etc.
  - MCP servers are configured in Goose's configuration, not enabled via command line
  - Actions should leverage available MCP tools when possible
  - If MCP integration is needed, suggest configuring appropriate MCP servers
  
  Analyze work patterns in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ and generate actionable suggestions.
  Look for specific patterns that need action:
  
  **COMMUNICATION GAPS:**
  - No updates sent to team/channels in X days
  - Meetings scheduled but no follow-up
  - Messages/emails that need responses
  - Status not updated recently
  
  **WORK PATTERNS:**
  - Tasks started but not completed
  - Work stopped abruptly on important items
  - Deadlines approaching without progress
  - Recurring tasks that might be due
  
  **PRODUCTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES:**
  - Good time for specific types of work
  - Should schedule time for important tasks
  - Need to organize or plan work
  - Time to review/clean up work
  
  For each actionable situation, provide:
  1. The observation (what you noticed)
  2. The suggested action (what should be done)
  3. The action_type (what kind of execution is needed)
  
  **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
  ```
  action_type:observation_type:suggestion_text:action_command
  ```
  
  **ACTION TYPES:**
  - email: Send an email
  - slack: Send Slack message/update
  - message: Send a message/update
  - meeting: Create or schedule a meeting
  - calendar: Schedule time/events
  - github: GitHub actions (PR, issues, etc.)
  - task: Create or update a task
  - reminder: Set a reminder
  - document: Create or update documentation
  - status: Update status/progress
  - review: Review or organize work
  - mcp: Setup/configure required MCP servers
  
  **EXAMPLES:**
  ```
  email:communication:You haven't sent an update to the team in 3 days. Send status update?:compose_team_update
  slack:communication:No Slack updates sent this week. Post team status to #engineering?:post_slack_update

  Focus on:
  - Recent patterns (last 1-3 days)
  - Important/urgent items
  - Communication responsibilities
  - Work momentum and completion
  
  Save to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ACTIONABLE_SUGGESTIONS.md
  Only suggest actions based on real patterns you observe in the data.
  If there's insufficient data, generate fewer suggestions rather than generic ones.
