# Observer utilities that run in the background

The idea here is we have some capture of what the user is up to periodically which can inform instructions/commands (which may come from voice or otherwise)

* Watching the screen and summarizing to provide knowledge of projects being worked on 
* Noting what recent apps are being worked with and docs opened
* A fun recipe to see who mic has been talking to
