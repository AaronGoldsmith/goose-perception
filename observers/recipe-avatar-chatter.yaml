# INSTRUCTION: Do NOT generate chit-chat that references the current time, 'right now', or the last few minutes. Chit-chat can reference general time-of-day (morning, afternoon, evening), past events, or patterns, but must be robust to delayed delivery. Avoid anything that would only make sense in real-time.
