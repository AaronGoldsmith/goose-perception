description: Generate frequent, casual, contextual chit-chat for avatar based on current activity
instructions: |
  Generate brief, casual conversational messages for the avatar to display frequently.
  These should be contextual but light - not formal suggestions, just friendly observations.
extensions:
- type: builtin
  name: developer
  display_name: Developer
  timeout: 120
  bundled: true

prompt: |
  CURRENT LOCAL TIME: $(date)
  TIMEZONE: $(date +%Z)
  
  Based on current activity from ~/.local/share/goose-perception/, generate 2-3 brief, casual chit-chat messages for an AI avatar.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Super casual and conversational (like a friend checking in)
  - Under 60 characters each
  - Based on actual current context, time, or patterns
  - NOT formal suggestions - just friendly observations
  - Use current time appropriately
  - Can reference real work patterns if visible
  
  Examples of good chit-chat:
  - "Still grinding at 2:30 PM? Nice focus!"
  - "I see lots of git activity today ðŸ“Š" 
  - "Coffee time? Your typing slowed down a bit â˜•"
  - "Friday afternoon vibes detected ðŸŽ‰"
  - "That's some serious deep work right there"
  - "I notice you switch tabs a lot when thinking ðŸ¤”"
  
  Output format (just the messages, one per line):
  message1
  message2
  message3
  
  Save casual chit-chat to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/AVATAR_CHATTER.md
  Keep it contextual but light - no pressure, just friendly AI companion vibes!
