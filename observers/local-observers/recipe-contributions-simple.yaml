  Analyze recent contributions and activity by looking at:
  
  1. Git activity in common directories (~/Documents, ~/code, etc.)
     - Recent commits in the past week
     - Modified files and their patterns
  
  2. Work activity from ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md
     - Extract mentions of files, projects, or repositories
  
  3. File system activity
     - Recently modified files in common work directories
  
  Create a simple summary of:
  - Projects/repositories worked on
  - Types of files modified
  - Patterns of activity
  - Key themes or focus areas
