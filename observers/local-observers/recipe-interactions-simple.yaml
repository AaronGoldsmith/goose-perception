  Analyze interactions and communications by looking at:
  
  1. Screenshot descriptions in /tmp/screenshot-descriptions (if any remain)
     - Look for mentions of chat applications, email, meetings
     - Extract people names and communication topics
  
  2. Work activity from ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md
     - Extract mentions of people, meetings, communications
  
  3. Spoken conversation log (if available)
     - Check ~/.local/share/goose-perception/spoken.txt for recent conversations
  
  Create a simple summary of:
  - People interacted with recently
  - Communication channels used (email, chat, meetings)
  - Key topics or themes in communications
  - Any follow-up actions mentioned
  
  Save this report to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/INTERACTIONS.md, appending new information to existing content.
