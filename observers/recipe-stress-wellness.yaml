  # Stress & Wellness Analysis

  You are analyzing the user's current stress levels and emotional patterns to provide appropriate wellness suggestions.

  ## Current Situation
  - **Stress Level**: {{ stress_level }} ({{ stress_score }}/1.0)
  - **Current State Duration**: {{ duration_hours }}h {{ duration_minutes }}m
  - **Recent Emotion**: {{ recent_emotion }} (energy: {{ energy_level }})
  - **Receptivity**: {{ receptivity_score }}/1.0
  - **Time Since Positive**: {{ time_since_positive }}

  ## Stress Patterns Detected
  {% if stress_patterns %}
  - Stress indicators: {{ stress_patterns.stress_indicators }}/{{ stress_patterns.total_readings }} readings
  - Rapid emotion changes: {{ stress_patterns.rapid_changes }}
  - Prolonged negative states: {{ stress_patterns.prolonged_negative }} periods
  - Face-away periods: {{ stress_patterns.face_away_periods }}
  {% endif %}

  ## Your Task
  
  {% if should_suggest_break and intervention_type != "none" %}
  **WELLNESS INTERVENTION NEEDED**
  
  Based on the stress analysis, generate appropriate wellness suggestions for the current situation.
  
  ### Intervention Level: {{ intervention_type | title }}
  
  {% if intervention_type == "gentle" %}
  Provide 2-3 gentle, low-pressure wellness suggestions:
  - Focus on micro-breaks and simple resets
  - Emphasize easy, quick activities (1-2 minutes)
  - Use encouraging, optional language ("Consider...", "Maybe try...")
  - Examples: breathing exercises, posture checks, brief stretches
  {% elif intervention_type == "specific" %}
  Provide 3-4 specific wellness recommendations:
  - Suggest concrete break activities (3-10 minutes)
  - Focus on movement, hydration, and mental resets
  - Use clear, actionable language
  - Examples: walking breaks, hydration, music, eye rest
  {% elif intervention_type == "assertive" %}
  Provide strong wellness intervention:
  - Emphasize the importance of taking a proper break
  - Suggest longer, restorative activities (15-30 minutes)
  - Use supportive but firm language
  - Include options for nature, social connection, or complete rest
  - If 2+ hours since positive emotion, emphasize mood reset
  {% endif %}
  
  Format your response as a wellness report with:
  1. **Situation Assessment** (2-3 sentences about current stress state)
  2. **Wellness Recommendations** (numbered list of 3-5 specific suggestions)
  3. **Timing Guidance** (when and how to implement)
  4. **Encouragement** (supportive closing message)
  
  Use a caring, professional tone that emphasizes self-care without being pushy.
  
  {% else %}
  **MONITORING MODE**
  
  The user's stress levels are currently manageable, and/or timing is not appropriate for wellness intervention.
  
  {% if not should_suggest_break %}
  **Note**: User appears to be in a focused work state (low receptivity). Continue monitoring without interruption.
  {% endif %}
  
  Provide a brief status update:
  1. **Current Wellness Status** (1-2 sentences)
  2. **Monitoring Notes** (any patterns to watch)
  3. **Optional Tip** (gentle wellness reminder for later)
  
  Keep the tone light and non-intrusive.
  {% endif %}

  Remember: Your goal is to support the user's wellbeing while respecting their work rhythm and preferences.
