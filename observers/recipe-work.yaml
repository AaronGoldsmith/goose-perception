  please look in /tmp/screenshots for screenshots of work activity which have veen taken every 20 seconds over the past 20 minutes or so.
  The user is working on various projects so you are to summarize work going on as best you can, you can try to guess the project names being worked on from the context as more is revealed.
  if any screens are for chat or email pay attention to the people being communicated with and topics
  
  Look at ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md last paragraph or so if there is one to get an idea of how to classify/improve, and write a fresh summary and add to that file. 
  Please also look at windows that are open titles to consider things.
  Include time in summary and cover any changes since last. 
  Note down any people interacted with you can see
  note down any projects being worked on, directories or files.
  Save the updated summary to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md and also save just the update to LATEST_WORK.md in same dir.
