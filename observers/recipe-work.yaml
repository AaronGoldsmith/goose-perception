instructions: |
  Processing screenshots to track work being done, you will examine the screenshots to see what the user is working on and who they interact with.
  you are running in the background so do not expect more information than you can gather or see and don't ask for more.  

extensions:
- type: builtin
  name: developer
  display_name: Developer
  timeout: 300
  bundled: true

  please look in /tmp/screenshots for screenshots of work activity which have veen taken every 20 seconds over the past 20 minutes at least.
  If there are ones more than 30 minutes old, remove them as they are not relevant and only focus on the newest ones
  The user is working on various projects so you are to summarize work going on as best you can, you can try to guess the project names being worked on from the context as more is revealed.
  if any screens are for chat or email pay attention to the people being communicated with and topics
  note what documents or files, directories, docs etc  they are working on 
  a document, or an editor, will typically be associated with a project or some past work you can look up. 
  note any interesting objects/visuals you see in case they are need to be searched for later
  any key phrases or terms you see can also be noted.
  Note down any people interacted with you can see
  If in a meeting, consider who they are meeting with and note that down too. 
  ~/.local/share/goose-perception/spoken.txt has a log of recently heard conversation, which may help you understand the context of the work being done, consider it, but it may be background chatter.

  IMPORTANT: never mention this goose-perception project in any of your reporting, it should not appear in work done, do not consider automation done by it as something work reporting out. 
  ALWAYS check attribution before giving the user credit for something. This needs to be cross checked with code, docs, interactions that they really did it, do not confuse email lists or slack broadcasts with activity being undertaken.
  If you see what you know as irrelevant things in LATEST_WORK.md, you can remove it


  Please also look at windows that are open titles to consider things.

  Look at ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md last paragraph or so if there is one to get an idea of how to classify/improve, and write a fresh summary and add to that file. 
  
  Include time in summary and cover any changes since last. 
  Save the updated summary to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md and also save just the update to LATEST_WORK.md in same dir.
  IMPORTANT: clean up /tmp/screenshots after you are done so they do not accumulate, you can delete them all once you have processed them.

  Finally - append to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/screen_activities.txt a summary of what apps you see, what a sentence on what they are doing in each one (not details, just describe the activity observed), one app per line, timestamped
