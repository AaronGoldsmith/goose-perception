  **Task: Export and review recent Chrome browsing history, without interrupting browser sessions.**
  
  **STEP 1: COPY HISTORY DATABASE**
  Copy the Chrome History file to a safe, queryable location:
  - Source: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
  - Destination: /tmp/History
  - Command:
    cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History /tmp/History
  
  **STEP 2: QUERY DATABASE WITH SQLITE3**
  Query the copied database for recent visits:
  
    sqlite3 /tmp/History 'SELECT url, title, last_visit_time FROM urls ORDER BY last_visit_time DESC LIMIT 10;'
  
  - `url`: Web address visited
  - `title`: Page title
  - `last_visit_time`: Last visit timestamp (WebKit/Chrome format; optional conversion if desired)
  
  **STEP 3: OUTPUT AND OPTIONAL PROCESSING**
  - Display browsing records in a readable format.
  - Adjust the number of records returned by changing the LIMIT or adding WHERE clauses (e.g., filter by domain or date).
  - You may refer to the current `~/.local/share/goose-perception/CHROME_HISTORY.md` to understand the user's previous browsing patterns.
  
  **OUTPUT:**
  An updated CHROME_HISTORY.md file summarizing the user's recent browsing patterns. Include: URLs, titles, and readable timestamps
  saved to ~/.local/share/goose-perception/CHROME_HISTORY.md
