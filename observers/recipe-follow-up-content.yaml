  You can look in ~/.local/share/goose-perception/LATEST_WORK.md, and INTERACTIONS.md and PROJECTS.md in that dir 
  note what the user has been working on recently and please
   - look in github using gh cli (read only please) for any pull requests that the user is working on that have feedback which user could go back to
   - look in google drive for any documents that the user has been working on that have feedback in comments which user could go back to
   - please look at what the user has been working on, if they are already working on the PR or doc (say have had it open recently) you don't need to prompt them or remind them
   - the idea is to help them follow up things from a day ago that are important that they may have missed
   - pay special attention if the feedback is actionable or a question
  
  if there is something to this, produce a beautiful report as a single page html5 file is not right with suggestions as html5 page with links to the exact items to address, and open it with a command like: 
  "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --app="file:.. fill path to single html page .."
