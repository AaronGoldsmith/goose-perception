  **Data Sources to Check:**
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/LATEST_WORK.md (current session activity)
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/PROJECTS.md (active projects)
  - ~/.local/share/goose-perception/WORK.md (work history)

  consider the content of those files, and also other .md files that may be in that directory. 
  Is the data in them still current? can you find evidence in cal or drive or in other files that it is relevant, is it old noise and not 
  really what they are working on now? edit it or remove the files. 
  Often the project and work information can get stale, so consider editing them.
  If a file is older than a week, remove it (.md, .html and .txt files)
  are there old files in the fixing or working dir.
