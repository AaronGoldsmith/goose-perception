prompt:
  in the  ~/.local/share/goose-perception/ directory please consult the follwing
     LATEST_WORK.md PROJECTS.md INTERACTIONS.md and CONTRIBUTIONS.md to form a picture of what the user has been working on. 
  You can also consider WORK.md for a more full log and INTERESTS.md for any interests.
  
  Based on this, can you look at any currently unread emails via the glean extension, which are addressed to the user directly, or with a small number of people it is sent to, which is pertenent to these tasks.
  If they appear urgent and important, consider notifying the user or making a brief report of actions to take. 
  Consider LATEST_WORK.md if they are actually working on it now, you can interrupt them more directly if needed, otherwise you can file it for later (notes app, reminders etc)  

  Pay special attention to if the email is from senior company leadership
